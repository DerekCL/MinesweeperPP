# Phase 1: Core Game Implementation Technical Specification âœ…

## 1. Core Game Components

### Implementation Details
- Created core classes:
  ```csharp
  public class Tile : Node2D
  public class GridManager : Node2D
  public class GameManager : Node2D
  public class UIManager : Control
  ```
- Implemented value objects:
  ```csharp
  public readonly struct TileState
  public readonly struct GridPosition
  public readonly struct GridConfiguration
  ```
- Defined game state enums:
  ```csharp
  public enum GameState
  {
      Ready,
      Playing,
      Paused,
      Won,
      Lost
  }

  public enum RevealResult
  {
      Safe,
      Mine,
      Invalid
  }
  ```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All core classes properly inherit from Godot base classes
- [x] Value objects are immutable and encapsulate related data
- [x] Enums clearly define all possible states and results

## 2. Grid Management

### Implementation Details
- Grid initialization and validation
- Mine placement using Fisher-Yates shuffle
- Adjacent mine calculation
- Recursive tile revelation
- Position validation and bounds checking

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Grid initializes with correct dimensions
- [x] Mines are placed randomly and counted correctly
- [x] Adjacent mine counts are accurate
- [x] Recursive revelation works for empty tiles
- [x] Invalid positions are properly handled

## 3. Game State Management

### Implementation Details
- Game state transitions
- First-click safety guarantee
- Win/loss detection
- Timer functionality
- Flag management

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Game starts in Ready state
- [x] First click is always safe
- [x] Win condition detected when all safe tiles revealed
- [x] Loss condition detected when mine clicked
- [x] Timer starts on first click
- [x] Timer pauses/resumes correctly
- [x] Flag count updates accurately

## 4. Basic UI Implementation

### Implementation Details
- Timer display
- Flag counter
- New game button
- Pause functionality
- Real-time updates

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Timer displays in 000 format
- [x] Flag counter shows remaining flags
- [x] New game button resets all state
- [x] Pause button toggles game state
- [x] UI updates reflect game state changes

## 5. Resource Management

### Implementation Details
- Proper resource disposal
- Memory management
- Scene tree integration
- Signal connections

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Resources are properly disposed
- [x] No memory leaks in long sessions
- [x] Signals are connected/disconnected appropriately
- [x] Scene tree hierarchy is maintained

## Dependencies
- Godot 4.x
- .NET 6.0+
- NUnit for testing

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all core classes
- Integration tests for component interaction
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Test doubles for Godot dependencies

## Performance Requirements
- Grid initialization < 100ms
- Tile revelation < 16ms (60 FPS)
- Memory usage < 100MB
- Smooth UI updates

## Security Considerations
- Input validation for all public methods
- Bounds checking for grid access
- Safe random number generation
- Protected game state
