# MinesweeperPP Project Overview

## Project Description
MinesweeperPP is a modern implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using C# and Godot 4. The project aims to create a polished, feature-rich version of Minesweeper while maintaining clean code practices and extensive test coverage.

## Architecture
The project follows a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components
1. **Tile**: Represents individual game tiles with properties for mine status, revealed state, and adjacent mine count.
2. **GridManager**: Handles grid operations, mine placement, and tile revelation logic.
3. **GameManager**: Manages game state, timer, and win/loss conditions.
4. **UIManager**: Controls the user interface elements and game interactions.

### Design Patterns
- **State Pattern**: Used for managing game states (Ready, Playing, Paused, Won, Lost)
- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented through Godot's signal system for UI updates
- **Value Objects**: Used for grid positions and tile states to prevent primitive obsession

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Game Implementation âœ…
- Basic grid generation and mine placement
- Tile reveal mechanics with recursive clearing
- Win/lose condition detection
- Basic UI elements (timer, mine counter)
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Phase 2: Game Features (Current)
- Difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)
- Custom game configuration
- High score system
- Game statistics tracking
- Save/load game state

### Phase 3: Enhanced UI/UX
- Animations and visual feedback
- Sound effects and music
- Theme customization
- Mobile-friendly controls
- Accessibility features

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Daily challenges
- Achievement system
- Online leaderboards
- Cross-platform support
- Localization

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core game logic
- Integration tests for component interaction
- UI automation tests
- Performance benchmarks

## Code Quality Standards
- Comprehensive XML documentation
- Consistent code style (enforced by .editorconfig)
- Regular code reviews
- Static code analysis
- Test coverage requirements
